title: REPRODUCIBLE RESEARCH IS ESSENTIAL
---

# Reproducible research is essential because
* it provides a complete record for the research community
* it allows other researchers to **replicate** each action in the study

# There are tools which make reproducible research practice much easier to implement
* Redcap (data collection, data management)
* R (statistical analysis) with knitr or jupyter notebooks (literate programming)
