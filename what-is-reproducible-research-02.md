# REPRODUCIBLE RESEARCH IS

> Reproducible research is the practice of conducting and presenting research in such a way that others, *and yourself* can later re-implement your research strategy without ambiguity.

> In the context of statistical collaboration, this means that you or someone else can easily reproduce all of your actions relating to data management and data analysis, and reach the same result.
