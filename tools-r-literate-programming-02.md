# Literate programming

Literate programming is a type of work flow in which
1 authoring a statistical analysis (including data management) and
1 authoring the interpretation of the results
occurs within a single script so that
1 statistical output (figures, tables, and in-line calculations) and
1 interpretation
are combined in an automated way.

# The advantages
* Each calculation in the final report is automatically linked to the corresponding code
* Literate programming avoids copy and paste errors because calculations are automatically inserted into the final report
* The entire analysis and report can be updated with a single command (or a single click) if the underlying data changes.
* EASY TO SHARE BOTH CODE AND INTERPRETATION
* Code is automatically organized by where it falls in the manuscript
